# PasswordGenerator
I m creating an password generator where anyone can generate a password which comes randomly with different symbols and lengths best for the safety purpose . Even anyone can copy that password at clipboard and save it for future. I m usnig react and tailwind css for the small project
here i have used 3 hooks of react 
1. usestate to have the record of the states
2. usecallback to optmizes functionality by which the browser can hold the amount cache that it can to make process smooth.
3. useReff to provides reference to the button value as it is the first thing that loads on the page while it reloads.
